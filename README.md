# Statistics-of-the-Sea-Ice
Sssignment for the Data Analysis in Physical Geography course  
In this assignment, we were trying to investigate the Sea ice and apply the statistic course exercises to this data. We will look at the Northern and southern hemisphere sea ice. If the time helps, I will try to find if there is a relation between Ice extent and (Sea Surface temperature, and fresh water input from rivers).
